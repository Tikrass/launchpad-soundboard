## Motivation

At the current point there is no open source software to play sound clips based on input from the Novation Launchpads. My primary goal is to implement a well designed controller for the "Novation Launchpad Mini". Maybe other Launchpads will be supported later.

## Usage 

This project is under active development, thus there is no running prototype yet.
